# Charts Demo

A playground to understand charts API from https://weeklycoding.com/mpandroidchart-documentation/. 

Purpose was to setup a simple chart that will display data over a week. User enters data into a text field, hits submit button, and the data is displayed for that day (yValue - user data, xValue - last day in the week).

In the Lento piano practice application, I will need to assign minutes practiced to its respective day in the current week and last 7 days if data is there.
